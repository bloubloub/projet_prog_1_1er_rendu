# projet_prog_1_1er_rendu

Here is my work for this first project.

To access to aritha and rapport.pdf, write "make" in your terminal.
To erase the additionnal files generated by the aforementioned command, write "make clean" in your terminal.

To test a file expression.exp, write the following sequence of instructions in your terminal:

./aritha expression.exp
gcc -no-pie -s expression.s -o expression
./expression

(where the last expression can be replaced by any name you choose)

The choices related to implementation are depicted in the file rapport.pdf

I don't exactly know what is supposed to be explicited in a README file, so I will stick to this minimum amount of information.
